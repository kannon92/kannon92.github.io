  "body": "### Welcome to Kevin Hannon and Jeff Schrieber's Project website.\r\nOur goal of this project is to parallelize some hotpots of our strongly correlated quantum chemistry program.  \r\n### Week 0\r\nWe presented a brief summary of our problem.  Jeff is going to work on a parallel program for computing the reference.  \r\n\r\nKevin is trying to parallelize the treatment of dynamic correlation.  Kevin's main difficulty in parallelizing the code is how to deal with the I/O that must occur.  As a first step, Kevin worked on using MPI to parallelize a part of the code that does not require I/O.  This seems to work well.\r\n### Week 1\r\n",
