  "body": "### Welcome to Kevin Hannon and Jeff Schrieber's Project website.\r\nOur goal of this project is to parallelize some hotpots of our strongly correlated quantum chemistry program.  \r\n\r\n### Week 0\r\nWe presented a brief summary of our problem.  Jeff is going to work on a parallel program for computing the reference.  We will present some of the main challenges of our report.    \r\n\r\nKevin is trying to parallelize the treatment of dynamic correlation.  Here is the main problems in treatment of dynamic correlation:  \r\n+ Tensor contractions are required for computing dynamic correlation.  \r\n+ Implementations of tensor contractions rely on efficient use of linear algebra software.  \r\n+ The tensors are large, so I/O will be a requirement.  \r\n\r\nKevin's main difficulty in parallelizing the code is how to deal with the I/O that must occur.  As a first step, Kevin worked on using MPI to parallelize a part of the code that does not require I/O.  This seems to work well.\r\n### Week 1\r\n",
